# The Axiom DAO Charter - Version 1.0

## 1. Mission and Purpose

The Axiom DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) exists for a single purpose: to ensure the long-term health, integrity, and adherence to the core mission of the Axiom protocol. The DAO is the final authority on all matters concerning the protocol's rules, technical parameters, and the allocation of community resources. Its primary responsibility is to act as a steward for the Axiom network, ensuring it remains a permanent, neutral, and universally accessible public utility for verifiable truth.

## 2. Scope of Power

The DAO has the power to propose, vote on, and execute changes to the Axiom protocol's network-level parameters. These include, but are not limited to:
- The list of official Bootstrap Nodes.
- The parameters of the Reputation Algorithm (e.g., rewards and penalties).
- The parameters of the AI engines (e.g., adding new `OPINION_WORDS`).
- Core software updates and versioning.
- Allocation of funds from the community treasury for development grants, security bounties, and operational costs.

The DAO explicitly does **not** have the power to add, delete, or modify individual facts within the Axiom Ledger. The Ledger is immutable and governed by the autonomous engine's rules of corroboration, not by popular vote.

## 3. Axiom Improvement Proposals (AIPs)

Any change to the protocol must be formalized as an Axiom Improvement Proposal (AIP).
- **Proposal:** Any community member may draft an AIP and submit it for discussion on the official community forum.
- **Sponsorship:** To be brought to a formal vote, an AIP must be sponsored by a node operator with a reputation score of 0.75 or higher.
- **Voting:** AIPs will be put to a vote accessible to all node operators. The voting period will last for 7 days.

## 4. Voting Power and Governance

Axiom's governance is a meritocracy based on contribution and reliability, not wealth.
- **One Node, One Vote (Weighted):** Each node operator may cast one vote per AIP.
- **Reputation Weighting:** The weight of a node's vote is directly proportional to its **reputation score** within the network at the time the vote commences. A node with a reputation of 0.8 has twice the voting power of a node with a reputation of 0.4.
- **Quorum:** For a vote to be considered valid, at least 20% of the total network reputation must participate in the vote.
- **Passing Threshold:** An AIP is approved if it achieves a simple majority (>50%) of the participating reputation-weighted votes.

## 5. Treasury and Funding

The Axiom DAO will be funded by voluntary donations and potential future protocol mechanisms as approved by the DAO. All funds will be held in a publicly auditable multi-signature wallet, controlled by trusted community members elected by the DAO.
