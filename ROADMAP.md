# The Axiom Project Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic development plan for the Axiom network. It is a living document that will be updated by the community as the project evolves. Our development is divided into distinct phases, each building upon the last to create a more intelligent, resilient, and useful public utility for truth.

## âœ… Phase 1: The Genesis Engine (V1) - COMPLETE

**Goal:** To prove the core concept of an autonomous, fact-gathering P2P network.

-   **[âœ“] Core Node Architecture:** A stable, production-ready Flask/Gunicorn server.
-   **[âœ“] Autonomous Learning Loop:** The ability to discover topics, find sources, and extract content.
-   **[âœ“] The Crucible (V1 & V2.1):** An AI filter to distinguish objective statements from opinion, now with an enhanced subjectivity filter.
-   **[âœ“] The Immutable Ledger:** A reliable SQLite database for storing facts.
-   **[âœ“] Professional Sourcing:** Migrated from direct scraping to the robust SerpApi, solving rate-limiting and anti-bot roadblocks.
-   **[âœ“] P2P Synchronization:** A basic protocol for nodes to share knowledge.
-   **[âœ“] Anonymous Query Layer:** A functional API endpoint for private user queries.
-   **[âœ“] Foundational Documentation:** Creation of `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `DAO_CHARTER.md`, and `LICENSE`.

## ðŸš§ Phase 2: The Resilient Network (V2) - IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** To harden the V1 prototype into a truly resilient, scalable, and intelligent network that can survive in the real world. This is our current focus.

### Sub-System: The AI Brain (Crucible & Synthesizer)
-   **[âœ“] V2.2 Contradiction Detection:** The database schema and core logic are in place to detect, flag, and link directly contradictory facts.
-   **[âœ“] V2.0 Fact Relationship Linking:** The `synthesizer.py` module and `fact_relationships` table are implemented, transforming the ledger from a simple list into a foundational Knowledge Graph.
-   **[PLANNED] V3.0 Coreference Resolution:** A major AI upgrade. Teach The Crucible to understand and resolve pronouns (e.g., "he," "she," "it") to create contextually complete facts.

### Sub-System: The Network (P2P & Governance)
-   **[PLANNED] V2.0 Robust Syncing:** Upgrade the P2P synchronization protocol from a simple hash-list comparison to a more efficient and scalable model using **Merkle Trees**.
-   **[PLANNED] V2.1 DAO Implementation:** Build out the off-chain infrastructure (e.g., a dedicated web portal or Discord bot) for submitting and voting on Axiom Improvement Proposals (AIPs), bringing the `DAO_CHARTER.md` to life.
-   **[PLANNED] V2.2 Node Anonymity:** Add an optional feature for node operators to route their outbound learning traffic through **Tor or a VPN** to protect their own privacy.
-   **[PLANNED] V3.0 Decentralized Discovery:** Evolve beyond reliance on centralized APIs. Implement new discovery modules like an "Encyclopedic Explorer" (crawling foundational knowledge) and a "Curiosity Engine" (autonomously investigating gaps in the ledger).

## ðŸš€ Phase 3: The Public Utility (Public Launch)

**Goal:** To build the user-facing tools and public infrastructure needed to bring Axiom to the world.

-   **[PLANNED] Public Bootstrap Node Deployment:**
    -   **Action:** Procure a cloud server (VPS) and a domain name (e.g., `axiom.foundation`).
    -   **Action:** Configure DNS to create a permanent, public address for at least one bootstrap node (e.g., `http://bootstrap.axiom.foundation:5000`).
    -   **Action:** Deploy a stable Axiom node to this server to run 24/7, serving as the main entry point for new contributors joining the network.
-   **[PLANNED] The Axiom Client (GUI):** Design and build the official open-source desktop client for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
    -   **V1: Simple Search:** A clean, minimal interface for submitting queries.
    -   **V2: Cognitive Prosthesis:** A more advanced UI, designed with input from UX and mental health experts, that helps users navigate conflicting information by visualizing evidence and providing consensus weights.
-   **[PLANNANED] The Public Website (`axiom.foundation`):** Launch the official website with clear explanations, a link to the whitepaper, and secure, signed downloads for the client.
-   **[PLANNED] GitHub Advanced Security:** Formally enable and configure CodeQL, Dependabot, and Secret Scanning to create a perpetually secure development environment.
-   **[PLANNED] Community Growth:** Actively engage with open-source, privacy, and academic communities to grow our base of node operators and contributors.
