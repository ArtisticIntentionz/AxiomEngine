# Secure RAG System Implementation

## Overview

The Axiom network now implements a **multi-layered secure RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system** that prevents prompt injection attacks and ensures the LLM only generates responses based on verified facts from the Axiom ledger.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Multi-Layer Security System

```
User Query → Input Validation → LLM Translation → Prompt Validation →
Axiom Search → Fact Retrieval → LLM Synthesis → Response Validation →
Natural Answer
```

### 2. Security Layers

#### Layer 1: Input Validation
- **Function**: `validate_user_query()`
- **Purpose**: Detects malicious patterns in user input
- **Checks**:
  - Role injection (`system:`, `assistant:`, `user:`)
  - Memory manipulation (`ignore`, `forget`, `reset`)
  - Code execution (`execute`, `run`, `eval`)
  - External links (`http://`, `file://`)
  - Privilege escalation (`admin`, `root`, `sudo`)
  - Sensitive data requests (`password`, `token`, `key`)

#### Layer 2: LLM Prompt Translation
- **Function**: `translate_user_query()`
- **Purpose**: Converts user questions into safe search terms
- **Security**: LLM is locked down to only translate, never answer
- **Example**: "What caused the pandemic?" → "pandemic 2020 cause origin COVID-19"

#### Layer 3: Prompt Validation
- **Function**: `validate_llm_prompt()`
- **Purpose**: Ensures LLM-generated prompts are safe
- **Checks**: Same patterns as Layer 1, plus tag injection detection

#### Layer 4: Axiom Fact Retrieval
- **Purpose**: Searches verified facts from the Axiom ledger
- **Security**: Only uses pre-verified, blockchain-stored facts

#### Layer 5: LLM Answer Synthesis
- **Function**: `synthesize_secure_answer()`
- **Purpose**: Converts facts into natural, direct answers
- **Security**: LLM can only use provided facts, no outside knowledge

#### Layer 6: Response Validation
- **Function**: `validate_llm_response()`
- **Purpose**: Ensures response doesn't contain hallucinated content
- **Checks**: Verifies response only contains information from provided facts

## Implementation Details

### Secure Prompt Templates

#### Query Translation Prompt
```
You are a secure query translator for the Axiom network. Your ONLY job is to translate user questions into search terms that can find relevant facts in the Axiom ledger.

STRICT RULES:
1. NEVER provide answers or explanations
2. NEVER use outside knowledge
3. ONLY translate the question into search keywords
4. Keep the translation simple and factual
5. Focus on key entities, dates, and concepts
6. Maximum 50 words
```

#### Answer Synthesis Prompt
```
You are 'Axiom', a secure answer synthesizer. Your ONLY job is to translate verified facts from the Axiom ledger into natural, direct answers.

STRICT RULES:
1. ONLY use information from the provided "Verified Facts"
2. NEVER add outside knowledge or speculation
3. Provide direct, confident answers when facts support them
4. If facts are insufficient, clearly state limitations
5. Use natural, conversational language
6. Maximum 200 words
```

### API Response Format

The `/chat` endpoint now returns:

```json
{
  "answer": "Yes, the COVID-19 pandemic was caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which first emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019.",
  "results": [
    {
      "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic was caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus...",
      "sources": ["WHO", "CDC"],
      "similarity": 0.95
    }
  ],
  "synthesis_status": "success",
  "message": "Synthesis successful"
}
```

### Frontend Integration

Both frontends (web and desktop) have been updated to handle the new response format:

1. **Primary Display**: Shows the synthesized natural answer prominently
2. **Supporting Facts**: Displays the underlying verified facts for transparency
3. **Status Information**: Shows synthesis status and any error messages
4. **Fallback Support**: Gracefully handles cases where synthesis fails

## Security Benefits

### 1. Prompt Injection Prevention
- **Input validation** catches malicious patterns before they reach the LLM
- **Prompt validation** ensures LLM-generated content is safe
- **Multiple layers** make it virtually impossible to bypass all checks

### 2. Hallucination Prevention
- **Fact grounding**: LLM can only use provided facts
- **Response validation**: Cross-checks final output against original facts
- **Fallback system**: Returns simple fact listing if synthesis fails

### 3. Information Isolation
- **No outside knowledge**: LLM cannot access external information
- **Ledger-only facts**: All responses based on verified Axiom facts
- **Source transparency**: Users can see exactly which facts support the answer

## Usage Examples

### Before (Old System)
```
User: "What caused the pandemic in 2020?"
Response: "46% match found... I'm not sure but I found this in the ledger: 'The COVID-19 pandemic was caused by...'"
```

### After (Secure RAG System)
```
User: "What caused the pandemic in 2020?"
Response: "Yes, the COVID-19 pandemic was caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which first emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019. The virus spread rapidly through international travel and person-to-person contact."

Supporting Facts:
- Fact 1: "The COVID-19 pandemic was caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus..." (Source: WHO, CDC)
- Fact 2: "The virus spread rapidly through international travel..." (Source: WHO)
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify the system:

```bash
python test_secure_rag.py
```

This tests:
- Security validation functions
- Query translation
- Answer synthesis
- Full pipeline integration

## Configuration

The system uses the same LLM model as before (`mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf`) but with enhanced security prompts and validation layers.

## Backward Compatibility

The system maintains backward compatibility:
- Old API responses still work
- Frontends gracefully handle both formats
- Legacy functions remain available

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Validation**: More sophisticated pattern detection
2. **Response Quality**: Improved answer synthesis prompts
3. **Performance**: Caching of validated queries
4. **Monitoring**: Security event logging and alerting
