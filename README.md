# Axiom: A Decentralized Network for Verifiable Truth - A Grounding Engine

![Axiom Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArtisticIntentionz/AxiomEngine/main/main/Axiom_logo.PNG)

**Axiom is a decentralized, autonomous, and anonymous P2P network
designed to create a permanent and verifiable public record of truth. It
is not a website or a search engine; it is a new, foundational layer for
knowledge, built to be immune to censorship, manipulation, and corporate
control.

Axiom IS NOT a truth engine it wont be a LIE detector it actually aims
to be a grounding engine that can ease the mind.**

## The Mission: A Bedrock for Reality

Our digital world is in crisis. We are drowning in information, but the
bedrock of shared, objective reality is fracturing. Search engines and
social media are not designed for truth; they are designed for
engagement. This has created a "hellhole" of misinformation, paranoia,
and noise—a problem that is not just theoretical, but a direct threat to
mental well-being and a functioning society.

Axiom was born from a deeply personal need for a tool that could filter
the signal from this noise. A tool that could provide clean, objective,
and verifiable information without the cryptic articles,
paranoia-inducing ads, and emotional manipulation of the modern web.

This project is a statement: **truth matters, and it should belong to
everyone.** We are building a public utility—a digital commonwealth—that
serves as a permanent, incorruptible, and safe harbor for human
knowledge.

## How It Works: An Autonomous Knowledge Organism

Axiom is not a static database; it is a living, learning network of
independent nodes. Each node executes a continuous, autonomous cycle.

### Phase 1: Learning
The engine begins by asking, "What is important to learn?" It uses a
**Discovery Engine** to find topics and a **Pathfinder** to find
reliable sources using the robust SerpApi, which prevents rate-limiting
and anti-bot roadblocks.

### Phase 2: Verification (The Crucible)
This is where **The Crucible**, Axiom's AI brain, takes over.

- **It is NOT a generative LLM.** The Crucible uses a lightweight
**Analytical AI (spaCy)** for precise Natural Language Processing. It
cannot "hallucinate" or invent facts.

- **It surgically extracts objective statements** while discarding
opinions, speculation, and biased language using an advanced
subjectivity filter.

- **The Corroboration Rule:** A fact is **never** trusted on first
sight. It is stored as `uncorroborated`. Only when another, independent,
high-trust source makes the same claim does its status become
**`trusted`**.

- **It detects contradictions.** If two trusted sources make opposing
claims, The Crucible flags both facts as `disputed`, removing them from
the pool of trusted knowledge.

### Phase 3: Understanding (The Synthesizer)
This is the V2 evolution of the network. Axiom doesn't just collect facts; it understands their relationships.

- **The Knowledge Graph:** After facts are created, **The Synthesizer**
analyzes them. It identifies shared entities (people, places,
organizations) between different facts.

- **Relationship Linking:** When a connection is found, it's stored in
the `fact_relationships` table. This transforms the ledger from a simple
list into a rich **Knowledge Graph**, allowing the network to understand
context.

### Phase 4: Memory & Sharing
- **The Immutable Ledger:** Every fact is cryptographically hashed and
stored in a local SQLite ledger.

- **Reputation-Aware Syncing:** Nodes constantly "gossip" and share
knowledge. This process is governed by a **reputation system** where
reliable nodes gain influence, providing a strong defense against
network-flooding (Sybil) attacks.

---

## Core Architecture & Technical Principles

- **Backend:** A multi-threaded Python application built on a
production-ready **Gunicorn/Flask** server.

- **Database:** A simple, robust **SQLite** database on each node
creates a distributed, redundant ledger.

- **AI:** Lightweight **spaCy** models for efficient NLP, allowing nodes
to run on standard hardware.

- **Anonymity:** End-user queries are protected by a **Tor-style
anonymous circuit**, ensuring the freedom to be curious without
surveillance.

- **Governance:** The network is designed to be governed by a **DAO
(Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**, where voting power is tied to
a node's proven reputation, not its wealth.

---

## The Axiom Ethos: Our Core Philosophies

- **Default to Skepticism:** The network's primary state is one of
disbelief. We would rather provide no answer than a wrong one.

- **Show, Don't Tell:** We do not ask for your trust; we provide the
tools for your verification. Every trusted fact is traceable back to its
sources.

- **Radical Transparency:** The entire codebase, the governance process,
and the logic of the AI are open-source.

- **Resilience over Speed:** The network is a patient, long-term
historian, not a high-frequency news ticker.

- **Empower the Individual:** This is a tool to give any individual the
ability to check a fact against the collective, verified knowledge of a
global community, privately and without fear.

## The Roadmap: From Prototype to Protocol

This project is ambitious, and we are just getting started. For a
detailed, up-to-date plan, please see our official
**[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** file.

---

## Current Status: Genesis Stage

**The Axiom Network is LIVE.**

The first Genesis Nodes are currently running, executing the V2 learning
cycles and populating the initial knowledge graph. The backend engine is
stable and feature-complete for its current version. The next major
phase is the development of the user-facing **Axiom Client** desktop
application.
