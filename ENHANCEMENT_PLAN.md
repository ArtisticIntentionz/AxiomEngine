## üéØ Key Improvements Made

### **1. Intelligent Question Understanding**
```python
# Before: Simple keyword search
keywords = ["ohio", "happened"]

# After: Question analysis
analysis = {
    "question_type": "temporal",
    "entities": ["Ohio"],
    "expected_answer_type": "event_description"
}
```

### **2. Structured Fact Extraction**
```python
# Before: Just store article titles
fact = "What happened in Ohio?"

# After: Extract structured facts
fact = {
    "subject": "Ohio",
    "predicate": "experienced",
    "object": "severe weather event",
    "fact_type": "event",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "sources": ["reuters.com", "ap.org"]
}
```

### **3. Intelligent Answer Synthesis**
```python
# Before: Return article list
results = [
    "Article 1 about Ohio",
    "Article 2 about Ohio",
    "Article 3 about Ohio"
]

# After: Synthesize intelligent answer
answer = {
    "text": "According to multiple sources including Reuters and AP, Ohio experienced severe weather conditions with over 900 law enforcement agencies participating in safety enforcement.",
    "confidence": 0.78,
    "supporting_facts": [...],
    "answer_type": "event_description"
}
```

### **4. Confidence Scoring**
```python
# Before: No confidence indication
# After: Clear confidence levels
confidence = {
    "score": 0.78,
    "level": "high",
    "factors": [
        "multiple_sources",
        "authoritative_sources",
        "recent_information"
    ]
}
```
